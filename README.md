# Employee-Analytics-Using-SQL-and-Power-BI
This project takes a deep dive into employee performance by combining the power of **MySQL** for data analysis and **Power BI** for clear, interactive visualizations. It looks at real HR challenges—like identifying top performers, spotting who’s ready for a promotion, figuring out which departments need more support, and even highlighting employees who might be struggling despite showing up every day. Using 19 thoughtful SQL queries, the project breaks down everything from peer ratings and training effectiveness to workload and manager feedback. The insights are then brought to life in Power BI dashboards, making it easy for HR teams and leadership to spot trends, make informed decisions, and build a stronger, more productive workforce.
